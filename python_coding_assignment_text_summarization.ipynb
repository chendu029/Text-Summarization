            "Last year we added Mabe group and even IFB on our consumer appliances front.\n",

            "So these are new generation products  autoimmunerequiring in the short term, additional materials, additional testing requirement, new manpower.\n",

            "That is what is behind the 40% guidance                 that we've done.\n",
            "Another is when we made the acquisition                 of Walter Pack, we have taken the loans for that.\n",
            "So there will be interest cost on that plus our                 internal accrual or our cash balance has been used to fund this acquisition which was earlier                 generating income and now this income will be very negligible income in FY24.\n",
            "So all three                 facts will make the PAT at 40% growth over last year.\n",
